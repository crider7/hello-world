There is a lot to know about me as an individual and professional.

If you asked me 10 years ago what I wanted to do as my career, the answer would be very different than what I am currently doing. Life has a funny way of changing directions and you find yourself in a place where you never thought would happen.

I graduated college in 2017 at Florida Gulf Coast University with two B.S. degrees in business specializing in PGA Golf Management and Resort & Hospitality Management. I was elected to the PGA of America and was going down the golf professional road as my career. Remember what I said about life? Well I ended up moving to Ohio for various reasons and was forced to change directions into automobile sales in a small town of Lima, Ohio. I truly enjoyed the learning and interactions with the other employees of the dealership and the members of the community. However, it was time to move back home to Florida for various reasons. Long story short, I am now a Customer Service Office Staff with Publix since 2019.

When I was going through my early years of education, I was infatuated with video games and thought how cool would it be to make my own game or be part of a team and create the next blockbuster with great gameplay and a story poeple will play in a decade from now. However, I always thought I wasn't smart enough to pursue that career path and moved away. Fast forward to now. A friend of mine suggested software engineering and after being introduced to HTML, I was hooked. I am studying through Codecademy in the Full-Stack path in hopes of possibly changing my career once again into tech in some capacity.

I understand that there is much to learn, but I am trying to learn and understand as I go.
